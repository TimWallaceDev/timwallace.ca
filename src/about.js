            Hello! I'm Tim Wallace, a passionate full-stack developer with a flair for creativity, thanks to my background in jazz trombone. I thrive on using modern frameworks like React and Express to build user-centric websites. When I'm not coding, you can find me on my YouTube channel, where I enjoy solving CSS challenges and sharing cool CSS techniques. My love for both learning and teaching keeps me motivated to continuously improve and expand my skills.
