            Hello! I'm Tim Wallace, a full-stack developer with a background in jazz trombone. My musical roots have taught me the value of timing, nuance, and simplicityâ€”principles I apply in my coding work, where I believe that less is often more. I specialize in building user-centered, performance-driven websites using modern frameworks like React, Express, and TypeScript, with a focus on clean code and intuitive design. My passion for learning drives me to continuously expand my skills in areas like API development, testing, and scalability.
