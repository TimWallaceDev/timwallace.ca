            Hi, I'm Tim Wallace, a web developer with a love for coding, bikes, and music. I discovered programming during the COVID-19 pandemic while creating a website for my band which marked a new chapter in my exploration of web development. When not immersed in coding, you'll find me in the world of music, often playing the trombone.
